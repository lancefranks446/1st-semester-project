Our team is the Powerpuff Men and it consists of Brain Salley, Nil Patel, and Harsh Patel. Our website is about a apartment complex in Blytheville Arkansas. We created 6 pages for our website including Home, Interior, Exterior,Location, Policies, and Contact. Throughout the entire website we have a title with a logo and a navbar. On the home page we have two pictures and a piece of text explaining what Sunshine apartments is all about! On the Interior page we have a fully functional 3d carousel that you can control with your cursor. It also has a quick description of the interior of the apartments. The exterior page has the same layout as the interior page but is for the exterior. Location is a page with an embedded map and a quick description of the surrounding area. Policies is a simple list of all the policies that you have to follow if you ever rent an apartment. The last page in Contact and is simply info with the phone number and list that the owner is available.
